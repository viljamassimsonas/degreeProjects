COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/bitcoin-breakout-above-31k-elusive-as-shorts-pile-in/," Bitcoin (BTC) has failed twice this week to establish a foothold above $31,000. Data from Coinalyze shows futures traders are likely responsible for keeping the gains under check. The first failed attempt on Monday at 20:05 UTC saw prices clock a high of $31,040 before quickly retreating back to $20,200 by 21:55 UTC. Open interest or the number of active stablecoin-margined (or linear) futures contracts tied to bitcoin rose from roughly 230,000 BTC to 242,000 BTC as prices pulled back from $31,040. A rise in open interest alongside a decline in price is said to indicate an influx of bearish short positions in the market. Futures short positions are leveraged bets that profit from a decline in the underlying asset's price. ""Price action suggested shorts piling in as we approached $31,000,"" crypto liquidity network Paradigm said in a market update published Tuesday, drawing attention to the uptick in open interest as prices turned lower from $31,040. A similar pattern was seen on Wednesday following the release of the softer-than-expected U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report that weakened the case for continued monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin printed a high of $31,000 immediately after the U.S. Labor Department released the CPI at 12:30 UTC only to fall back to $30,500 in the next one hour. The retreat was once again accompanied by an increase in open interest in stablecoin-margined futures contracts. The bearish activity around $31,000 has established the said level as key resistance to watch out for in the short-term.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/13/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-holds-steady-over-30k-as-inflation-data-macro-issues-leave-investors-increasingly-unmoved/," Good morning. Here’s what’s happening: Prices: After a morning surge, bitcoin spent the day in its most recent range well above $30K. Insights: Commodity or security? Former CFTC Chair Timoth Massad says the determination can wait. Bitcoin Ignores Inflation Data Bitcoin seemed headed for brighter days in the immediate aftermath of a mildly surprising decline in the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) Wednesday, before retreating into the shadows it's occupied for the better part of a month well below $31,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,357, down 0.8% over the past 24 hours. BTC surged in the hour immediately following the CPI release, a 3% increase that was lower than expected and down from 4% the previous month, as investors quickly lost their enthusiasm. On-chain data this morning that showed two wallets – labeled as belonging to the U.S. government and linked to seized bitcoin holdings from the Silk Road marketplace – moving 9,825 bitcoin ($301 million) in three transactions may have outweighed the positive inflation report. With a few blips, bitcoin has been range-bound between $30,000 and $31,000 for much of the time since June 20 as investors fretted over a renewal of hawkish interest rate hikes that could cast the economy into a steep recession. Federal Reserve officials have said repeatedly that they intend on raising interest rates 25 basis points (bps) later this month after pausing a year-long diet of monetary hawkishness in June. Those worries and often confounding macroeconomic data have trumped euphoria that bubbled up earlier in June after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and other financial services giants applied for elusive spot bitcoin ETFs. The SEC, which has rejected multiple such applications over the past two years, is unlikely to come to a decision any time soon, leaving markets unclear about the next price catalyst. Still, sentiment has turned bullish with two respected research groups over the past week that BTC could soar to $120,000 or higher by the end of 2024 and other signals, including the CoinDesk bitcoin market indicator pointing upward. In a Telegram message to CoinDesk, Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, noted that over the past two years, the supply of BTC that remains unmoved for more than a year has reached an all-time high of nearly 70%. ""This data suggests that the dominant bitcoin investor right now is the long-term ‘hodler,’ Savic wrote. ""This cohort is less likely to be sensitive to macro considerations.""

Other major cryptos were largely in the red with MATIC and AVAX, the tokens of smart contracts platform Polygon and Avalanche, down more than 4% and 2%, respectively. The Crypto Market Index, a measure of crypto markets' performance, was off 1.9%. Equity markets liked the sound of falling inflation better than cryptos with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 1.1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) also declining. Traditional safe haven gold ticked upward slightly. FRNT's Savic noted stocks' and cryptos veering path, a trend that took flight months ago. ""We’ve seen a decline in correlations between bitcoin and traditional assets heading into this CPI release, and that has been a strong theme in 2023,"" he wrote. Tim Massad's Incremental Approach to Crypto Regulation Regulatory agencies don’t have to immediately settle whether crypto is a security or a commodity, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Timothy Massad told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Wednesday. Echoing a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he and former Securities and Exchange Commissioner (SEC) Jay Clayton co-authored last week, Massad said that the CFTC and SEC could create basic investor and market protection standards for exchanges through a self-regulatory organization as an incremental step before determining digital assets’ status. “We're very deliberately saying, we don't have to resolve that in order to put in place some basic investor protection standards,” Massad said. “We're not saying that's not an important issue. It is and I don't want to limit the SE C's ability to say, this (crypto) is a security (and) you really have to comply. But what we're saying is, look, we have platforms today that are trading things – maybe they're securities, maybe they're commodities. Put in place standards on protecting customer assets, preventing fraud and manipulation, prohibiting conflicts of interest requiring reporting and recording of information.” Massad and Clayton’s recommendations come at a potentially pivotal time in crypto’s brief history, and amid an ongoing jurisdictional feud between the CFTC, which considers crypto a commodity and the SEC, which sees it as a security. Both agencies have filed multiple legal actions against exchanges and other key crypto organizations, testing the applicability of current regulations but leaving investors and entrepreneurs deeply unsettled about crypto’s future in the U.S., which has largely spearheaded global interest in the space. Last month, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, saying the exchanges had violated securities laws by, among other things, offering unregistered securities.

Read More: Singapore: The Center of Asian Crypto Wealth Is Ready for a Reset Massad said that the piecemeal approach would offer at least some certainty while the various cases wind their way through the courts, and agencies continue to debate over the nature of crypto. “Cases brought by the SEC and the CFTC aren't going to bring us to sort of comprehensive investor protection standards quickly,” he noted. Massad said that Congress could apply the incremental standards to any platform trading bitcoin or ether, which account for more than two-thirds of the crypto market’s total value, as a sort of test. “There's no platform out there that's significant, that's not trading both of those tokens,” he said. “So that's the hook. That's the way to say, ‘here are the intermediaries that these standards apply to without having to resolve what's a security and what's not a security.” He added: “We're going to say ‘look, that can still be litigated and let's require these platforms to provide some basic disclosure on a token before it's listed for trading.’ And that actually will help us determine what's a security. You can't really answer what's a security unless you know is there a common enterprise behind this, are there managerial efforts that people are looking toward to increase its value? We need disclosure to figure that out?” 8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 p.m. UTC): Producer Price Index (June/MoM/YoY) 8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 p.m. UTC): Initial Jobless Claims (July 7) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV: Bitcoin Nears $31K as Inflation Rose Less Than Expected; Crypto Oversight Bill Re-Launch The U.S. inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) slipped to 3.0% on a year-over-year basis in June from 4.0% in May.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/bitcoin-shrugs-off-solid-inflation-report-holds-steady-over-30k/," U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% in June, beating expectations for a 0.3% increase. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices also surpassed forecasts, rising 4.8% versus consensus estimates of 5%. The overall inflation rate in the U.S. is now 3% compared to 9.1% in June 2022. The upbeat inflation news should have logically sent bitcoin higher in the immediate aftermath, but instead the price declined, even as volatility spiked. BTC’s price ranged from a high of $31,122 to a low of $30,575, although BTC’s hourly candles fluctuated between red and green like a malfunctioning traffic light. BTC and other cryptos’ sluggish performance may reflect the lessening impact of CPI compared to other inflation data on crypto markets compared to other inflation data and of traditional finance (TradFi) indicators that previously weighed on investors. One data point, two time horizons Investors’ view of Wednesday’s market is likely colored by their preferred time frame. While bitcoin’s hourly chart displays volatile price moves grappling with today’s CPI news, its daily price chart implies the opposite, with range-bound trading, and declining volatility. Bitcoin’s daily price wasn’t the only thing that shrugged at today’s data point. Per the CME Fedwatch tool, expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would raise rates 25 basis points on July 26 are 94.9%, versus 93% a day prior.  Today’s report appeared to change nothing specific to the FOMC’s upcoming policy decision, and BTC prices are reacting as such. Major equity indexes traded higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 all increasing. Still crypto markets have largely decoupled from TradFi during 2023, with only the most surprising economic reports moving markets significantly. While we watch CPI, the Fed seems to prefer PCE While CPI gets a lot of attention, the FOMC’s favored measure of inflation appears to be U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). In the most recent release of FOMC minutes, PCE is mentioned 10 times compared to three mentions of CPI. More importantly, the FOMC made projections for the former, rather than the latter, raising expectations for a decline in quarterly core personal consumption expenditures in the second and third quarters of 2023. All told, while CPI is moving in the right direction, the magnitude of change appears to fall within the expectations that crypto investors previously held. The next PCE reading will be released on July 27, two days after the FOMC’s next rate decision meeting begins.",us consumer s rise in june beating expectation for a increase core inflation which exclude more volatile food and energy s also surpass forecast rise versus consensus estimate of the overall inflation rate in the us be now compare to in june the upbeat inflation news should have logically send high in the immediate aftermath but instead the decline even as volatility spike s range from a high of to a low of although s hourly candle fluctuate between red and green like a malfunctioning traffic light and other s sluggish performance may reflect the lessening impact of cpi compare to other inflation data on s compare to other inflation data and of traditional finance tradfi indicator that previously weigh on investor one data point two time horizon investor view of wednesday be likely color by their preferred time frame while s hourly chart display volatile move grapple with today cpi news its daily chart imply the opposite with rangebound trading and decline volatility s daily wasnt the only thing that shrug at today data point per the cme fedwatch tool expectation that the federal open committee fomc would raise rate basis point on july be versus a day prior today report appear to change nothing specific to the fomcs upcoming policy decision and s be react as such major equity index trade higher with the dow jones industrial average djia nasdaq composite and s & p all increase still s have largely decouple from tradfi during with only the most surprising economic report move s significantly while we watch cpi the fed seem to prefer pce while cpi get a lot of attention the fomcs favor measure of inflation appear to be us personal consumption expenditures pce in the most recent release of fomc minute pce be mention time compare to three mention of cpi more importantly the fomc make projection for the former rather than the latter raise expectation for a decline in quarterly core personal consumption expenditure in the second and third quarter of all tell while cpi be move in the right direction the magnitude of change appear to fall within the expectation that investor previously hold the next pce reading will be release on july two day after the fomcs next rate decision meeting begin,4,3,0.6666666666666666,"[('inflation', 6), ('cpi', 6), ('expectation', 4), ('compare', 4), ('data', 4), ('pce', 4), ('rate', 3), ('decline', 3)]"
COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/even-as-inflation-risk-fades-bitcoin-remains-stuck-below-31k/," Bitcoin (BTC) investors received what should have been welcome economic news Wednesday as the government reported a big slowdown in U.S. inflation. And, indeed, bitcoin's price quickly shot up to almost $31,000 following the report. It didn't last long. As of press time, BTC had pulled back below $30,500, down more than 1% from where it was before the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released. The report showed consumer prices increased 3% year-over-year in June, versus the 4% gain in May. Even better, the core rate – which excludes food and energy prices – slowed to a 4.8% increase after stubbornly holding above 5% earlier in 2023. To the extent that speedy inflation has been among the headwinds sending bitcoin tumbling from its peak near $70,000 in November 2021, fading inflation risks would seemingly be supportive. That this didn't happen today brings forth a few issues. First, perhaps it's another in what's been a number of inflation head fakes in the Covid era. Remember 2021's ""transitory"" phase in which the U.S. Federal Reserve was convinced it didn't need to act on rising inflation due to its expectation that it was a temporary blip? Commenting on this morning's CPI, The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos was reminded of inflation reports in July and August 2021, which seemed to confirm that hypothesis before subsequent data said otherwise. Timiraos doesn't expect the Fed to be swayed from its path of additional rate hikes in 2023 by just this morning's data. Second, there was more news today than just the CPI print. On-chain data this morning showed two wallets labeled as belonging to the U.S. government and linked to seized bitcoin holdings from the Silk Road marketplace moved 9,825 bitcoin ($301 million) in three transactions. That sort of selling pressure may have more than balanced out any good inflation news. Finally, markets anticipate. The price of bitcoin has risen more than 20% since mid-June. While the catalyst for that is commonly thought to be the BlackRock spot ETF application (and subsequent filings by a number of other asset managers, including Fidelity), perhaps some of the bullish action was due to markets sniffing out the improved June inflation report. As Timiraos further noted, observers had been talking about sizable softening in some of the CPI components for some time. Maybe doubly frustrating the bitcoin bulls today is that traditional markets appear to have fully embraced the weaker inflation report. The dollar index is off more than 1%, which is exactly what one might expect if inflation concerns and subsequently the chances of future Fed rate hikes were receding. The 10-year Treasury yield is off a full 13 basis points (0.13%) to 3.84% and the two-year yield is down the same amount to 4.74%. And while bitcoin resides in the red on Wednesday, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are ahead by about 1% and hitting new all-time highs.",investor receive what should have be welcome economic news wednesday as the government report a big slowdown in us inflation and indeed s quickly shoot up to almost follow the report it didnt last long as of press time have pull back below down more than from where it be before the consumer index cpi data be release the report show consumer s increase yearoveryear in june versus the gain in may even better the core rate which exclude food and energy s slow to a increase after stubbornly hold above earlier in to the extent that speedy inflation have be among the headwind send tumble from its peak near in november fading inflation risk would seemingly be supportive that this didnt happen today bring forth a few issue first perhaps its another in whats be a number of inflation head fake in the covid era remember s transitory phase in which the us federal reserve be convince it didnt need to act on rise inflation due to its expectation that it be a temporary blip comment on this morning cpi the wall street journal nick timiraos be remind of inflation report in july and august which seem to confirm that hypothesis before subsequent data say otherwise timiraos doesnt expect the fed to be sway from its path of additional rate hike in by just this morning data second there be more news today than just the cpi print onchain data this morning show two wallet label as belonging to the us government and link to seize holding from the silk road place move million in three transaction that sort of sell pressure may have more than balance out any good inflation news finally s anticipate the of have rise more than since midjune while the catalyst for that be commonly think to be the blackrock spot etf application and subsequent filing by a number of other manager include fidelity perhaps some of the bullish action be due to s sniff out the improved june inflation report as timiraos far note observer have be talk about sizable softening in some of the cpi component for some time maybe doubly frustrate the bull today be that traditional s appear to have fully embrace the weak inflation report the dollar index be off more than which be exactly what one might expect if inflation concern and subsequently the chance of future feed rate hike be recede the year treasury yield be off a full basis point to and the twoyear yield be down the same amount to and while resides in the red on wednesday both the nasdaq and s & p be ahead by about and hit new alltime high,4,1,0.6333333333333333,"[('inflation', 10), ('report', 6), ('cpi', 4), ('data', 4), ('news', 3), ('rate', 3), ('today', 3), ('morning', 3)]"

According to SEBA Bank, $29,500 and $31,500 are key levels to watch on the downside and upside for the cryptocurrency, and the team takes note of bitcoin’s twenty-day moving average as close to the psychologically significant $30,000 mark. “We may see a breakout of these key levels post today’s data,” said the bank in a morning note. Economists forcasts the headline year-on-year CPI is likely to have cooled to 3.1% in June from May's 4.0%, with the core figure slowing to 5% from 5.3%. Altcoins also saw some gains early Wednesday, with AAVE adding just under 7% over the past 24 hours and bitcoin cash (BCH) up 4.5%. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) jumped as much as 16% Tuesday after disclosure of a deal with Cboe’s BZX Exchange to maintain a surveillance-sharing agreement for five of its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. The shares ultimately closed higher by just shy of 10%. The agreement was made on June 21 for each of these applications, amendments  to original filings filed showed. The surveillance-sharing agreement, also referred to as SSA, has become an integral part of all ETF applications filed recently as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated for years that these arrangements are necessary to prevent market manipulation. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest sold $12 million worth of Coinbase’s shares on Tuesday as the stock surged higher following the above-mentioned surveillance-sharing agreement. The sales, however, were only a small fraction of the nearly 11 million shares owned across all of ARK’s funds, with COIN being a 6.2% holding for the fund management company.  The estimated cost average for COIN across the various funds are, $239.60 for the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), $254.65 for Ark’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), and $242 for ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), according to market data. Though COIN is now ahead 165% for 2023, yesterday’s closing price of $89.15 remains far below those levels. - Omkar Godbole Edited by  Stephen Alpher.",be trade slightly high on wednesday ahead of the us inflation report for june up just shy of at about accord to seba bank and be key level to watch on the downside and upside for the and the team take note of s twentyday move average as close to the psychologically significant mark we may see a breakout of these key level post today data say the bank in a morning note economist forcasts the headline yearonyear cpi be likely to have cool to in june from may with the core figure slow to from altcoins also saw some gain early wednesday with aave add just under over the past hour and cash bch up share of coinbase coin jump as much as tuesday after disclosure of a deal with cboes bzx exchange to maintain a surveillancesharing agreement for five of its spot exchangetraded fund etf application the share ultimately close high by just shy of the agreement be make on june for each of these application amendment to original filing file show the surveillancesharing agreement also refer to as ssa have become an integral part of all etf application file recently as the us security and exchange commission sec have state for year that these arrangement be necessary to prevent manipulation cathie wood ark invest sell million worth of coinbases share on tuesday as the stock surge higher follow the abovementioned surveillancesharing agreement the sale however be only a small fraction of the nearly million share own across all of ark fund with coin be a hold for the fund management company the estimate cost average for coin across the various fund be for the ark fintech innovation etf arkf for ark ark innovation etf arkk and for ark next generation internet etf arkw accord to data though coin be now ahead for yesterday closing of remains far below those level omkar godbole edit by stephen alpher,5,0,0.8367346938775511,"[('ark', 6), ('etf', 5), ('share', 4), ('coin', 4), ('agreement', 4), ('fund', 4), ('june', 3), ('level', 3)]"
COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/bitcoin-april-2024-forecast-raised-to-566k-berenberg/," Berenberg raised its bitcoin (BTC) price forecast for April 2024 to $56,630, the investment bank said in an analyst report Wednesday. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading around $30,800 at publication time. “Supporting our expectation that bitcoin will appreciate significantly in the coming months is improved sentiment driven by anticipation of the bitcoin halving estimated to occur in April 2024, and keen interest demonstrated by large institutions,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote. The bank reiterated its buy rating on stock of MicroStrategy, a business intelligence software developer that has invested heavily in bitcoin, and raised its share price target to $510 from $430 due to a higher estimate of the value of the company’s BTC holdings and improved forecast for the value of its software business. The shares closed Tuesday at $411.18. The bank said it was raising its estimates for the value of the company's bitcoin holdings as of late April 2024 to $8.74 billion from $6.27 billion. It increased its estimate for the value of the business intelligence software business to $1.37 billion from $859 million.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/12/microstrategy-only-needs-to-liquidate-bitcoin-in-extreme-price-corrections-bernstein/," Higher bitcoin prices means MicroStrategy has a stronger balance sheet, a higher share price and easier debt repayment without the need to sell down its cryptocurrency holdings, the report said. Furthermore, strong bitcoin prices and a higher stock price, allows the company to raise new debt or equity and to redeem existing convertible notes, the broker said. Conversely, if bitcoin crashes and reaches “absolute depressed prices” and the value of MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency holdings do not cover debt and certain covenants post June 2025, the “corporate structure would come under pressure from ‘spring forward’ clauses - 2028 due debt does have liquidity covenants which could spring forward the debt to 2025/26”, the report added. “Given bitcoin’s volatility, using debt as a strategy is always precarious, and one-off forced liquidations can never be ruled out completely,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. MicroStrategy holds around 152,000 bitcoin, with a total cost basis of about $4.5 billion, and an average price of roughly $29,600, the note said. The market value of MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency assets form about 0.78% of the total bitcoin in supply and account for around 20% of daily average BTC trading volume, the analysts wrote. The market value of bitcoin assets form 95% of the market capitalization of MicroStrategy and net of debt raised to buy BTC, equate to about 49% of the market cap of the company, the report added. MicroStrategy’s ability to refinance its debt maturities would be greatly enhanced if its share price, and the value of its bitcoin holdings, were to increase meaningfully, investment bank Berenberg said in a report on Monday.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/crypto-traders-prepare-for-bitcoin-volatility-as-focus-shifts-to-us-cpi/," ""Bollinger bands are tight. How tight? Squeezes of this caliber have only ever occurred a handful of times in the past decade. Most squeezes like this have tipped the market bias before the breakout,"" analyst Josh Olszewicz tweeted early Wednesday, adding that a similar tightening of bands was last seen in early January, just before bitcoin's bull revival. The so-called squeeze or tightening of bitcoin's Bollinger bands has also caught the eye of John Bollinger, the inventor of the indicator. Bollinger bands are derived by placing volatility lines two standard deviations above and below the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the asset price. The bands are driven by the degree of price turbulence, with the squeeze or tightening of the bands representing volatility contraction and the widening of bands representing volatility explosion. When bands tighten sharply, traders prepare for a big move and usually trade in the direction in which prices breach the band. The logic is that the market builds energy during consolidation, which is eventually unleashed in either direction. The most common method of tracking the bandwidth is to divide the spread between the upper and lower bands with the 20-day SMA of prices. Bitcoin's Bollinger bandwidth has declined to 0.04, the lowest since early January, according to the charting platform TradingView. As per pseudonymous analyst Nunya Bizniz the bandwidth has been this low only a handful of times in bitcoin's 14-year history, and we might see a volatility explosion soon. Tighter bands do not always imply immediate and notable volatility explosion/directional clarity in the market. That said, the U.S. CPI data, scheduled for release on Wednesday at 12:30 UTC, will likely influence the Federal Reserve interest rate expectations and inject volatility into markets. Per economists polled by Wall Street Journal, the headline year-on-year CPI is likely to have cooled to 3.1% in June from May's 4.0%, with the core figure slowing to 5% from 5.3%. A reading of 3.1% would bring the headline closer to the Fed's target of 2%, weakening the case of continued interest rate hikes or monetary tightening that was partly responsible for last year's crypto crash. In other words, bitcoin may break out of the Bollinger band squeeze if the inflation data matches estimates. Note that expectations for a big drop in CPI have been amped up by a report released Tuesday that showed used car prices, one of the key components of the U.S. CPI, tanked by 10.3% over the past year, recording the 10th straight monthly decline in June. So, risk assets, including bitcoin, may see downside volatility if the headline CPI and the core figure come in hotter-than-expected.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/first-mover-asia-crypto-market-is-on-standby-as-release-of-june-inflation-data-nears/," Prices: What's going to move bitcoin away from $30,000? Insights: A freely convertible Chinese Yuan is a requirement for a CNY stablecoin. That's not going to happen anytime soon. Bitcoin is Looking at a 2024 Bull Market, But is $120,000 Realistic? As Asia opens for its trading day, bitcoin continues to maintain the $30,000 mark, while ether is flat. Coinglass data shows that in the last 12 hours, slightly more long liquidations than short liquidations occurred with $7 million longs and $6.73 million shorts liquidated. “The market is on standby, awaiting signals of price increase following a slowdown or pause in rate hikes in the second half of the year, which would be characterized by liquidity inflow,” Bybit’s Ether Chen, its lead financial engineer, told CoinDesk in a note. Chen said that Bybit’s team expects a potential market price recovery in the fourth quarter, but a full bull market might not materialize until 2024. This recovery would be contingent upon the cessation of rate hikes, BTC halving and the resolution of regulatory storms. Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App points to slowing inflation figures but a market confidence that the Federal Reserve will still hike rates as sort of a mixed messaging, and dismisses a recent report from Standard Chartered that bitcoin will hit $120,000 by the end of next year. “For crypto assets, this all likely means continued range trading around current levels. Bitcoin seems to be holding fairly close to $30,000 at the moment which is a near 100% increase from January when it started the year at $16,540,” he said in a note. “There are few assets that perform this well in a ""bear"" market, and canny seasoned traders will likely have done well on BTC this year.” Regardless of whether or not Standard Chartered’s price prediction is correct, Frost sees a bull market on the horizon for 2024. “The long-range consensus remains that crypto will enter its next bull market in 2024 following a period of continued consolidation this year and, behind closed doors, huge innovation is paving the way for the next wave of crypto adoption,” he concludes. Here's Why we Won't See a CNY Stablecoin Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire argues that a stablecoin pegged to the Chinese Yuan (CNY) is a better option than a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). But a yuan stablecoin isn’t going to happen, just like a Chinese CBDC isn’t going to challenge the dollar. Why? Because the free convertibility of the yuan goes against a core fundamental of Beijing’s monetary policy. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) maintains strict control over the exchange rate of the yuan, keeping it within a narrow band and not allowing it to float freely in international markets. This allows China to maintain control over its export prices and its domestic economy. But it also means that the yuan can’t be used offshore, like the Euro or the USD, and there are strict capital controls on how much you can bring out of the country. The more you want your currency used internationally, the more control you need to be willing to cede. As the IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath pointed out in a 2022 address, these aren’t the traits of a global currency. After all, the yuan is only used in around 3.2% of global payments as of January 2022. ""If a country is aspiring to be a global currency, then in that case, you would need to have, you know, basically fully and freely mobile capital, full capital account liberalization, full convertibility of exchange rate, which is not the case right now in China,"" Gopinath is quoted as saying. Currency manipulation has been a contentious issue in U.S.-China relations, and, in 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury labeled the country a currency manipulator. But you know who else has been on the radar of Washington as a currency manipulator? Taiwan. Unlike China, Taiwan does not actively intervene to keep its currency, the New Taiwan Dollar (TWD), artificially low to boost exports. Instead, Taiwan has been known to intervene to prevent rapid appreciation of its currency which could harm its export-driven economy. This has been an issue since 1989, when the U.S. Senate subcommittee on international trade called a hearing on currency manipulation. David Mulford, the then Under Secretary-Designate, Office of International Affairs, Department of the Treasury, noted the large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market by Taiwan's Central Bank, and a lack of significant exchange rate appreciation despite Taiwan running large external surpluses. For its part, Taipei denies that it's an active currency manipulator or has capital controls pointing to the openness of foreign investment in its equities market and the free convertibility of foreign currency on its shores. But if there’s one thing that unites Taipei and Beijing, its that central bankers in neither capital want to relinquish control of their currencies to the market. 1 p.m. HKT/SGT(UTC): Bank of England Financial Stability Report 8:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 p.m. UTC): U.S. Consumer Price Index (June/MoM/YoY) 7:50 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:50 p.m. UTC/July 11): Japan Producer Price Index In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV: Justin Sun on State of Crypto Regulation; EU's Metaverse Strategy TRON founder and Huobi global advisor Justin Sun joined ""First Mover"" to discuss the state of crypto regulation, outlook on Hong Kong, and much more.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/bitcoin-quiets-down-in-july-after-a-tumultuous-first-half-of-2023/," This year has been strong for bitcoin, with prices up 84% year to date. However, month-to-month data shows that much of the gains occurred during the winter, with January and March registering average daily returns of 1.11% and 0.73% respectively. June performance was strong as well, with its 0.41% average daily gain largely driven by BlackRock’s spot ETF announcement. February and April were relatively flat, while May has been BTC’s only negative performing month this year. Historically, July has been strong for bitcoin. Since 2014, BTC has risen an average 0.39% in July, third highest among all months. When measuring from 2020, July finishes second (to October), with a 0.57% average daily gain. Extrapolated over 30 trading days, the performance amounts to approximate monthly gains of 12% and 19%, respectively. This has not been the case for 2023 however, as the average daily gain in July has been just 0.03%, approximately 0.93% higher if calculated over 30 days. While bitcoin’s price has trended higher throughout 2023, the trajectory of daily gains by month has moved in the opposite direction. For all of the excitement around BTC’s rise, it's still a beginning-of-the-year phenomenon. Pessimistic investors would likely consider the trend concerning for BTC prices. Optimistic ones would likely anchor to the fact that bitcoin has maintained its early year increase. On-chain data from Glassnode indicates that 74% of bitcoin addresses are in profit, which likely scores one for the bulls. A high percentage of BTC holders in profit implies an investor base likely to hold its current position, especially following the sharp 2023 run-up. A potential headwind exists in Wednesday’s CPI release, the first key inflationary data since the middle of June. Forecasts indicate that month-over-month prices increased 0.3%. A larger increase could potentially weigh on prices. Still, with markets already expecting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to raise interest rates in July, it would likely take a huge increase to move prices significantly. Finally, the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin Trend Indicator continues to signal that BTC is in a significant uptrend, a sign that short-term prices are moving higher than long-term averages.

He said that the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent enforcement actions against crypto companies, such as Coinbase and Binance, have been driving entrepreneurs out of the United States, which in turn has hurt the price of bitcoin. But that doesn’t change how valuable bitcoin and its underlying technology are, according to Draper.

""I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in bitcoin, invest it all in bitcoin, have my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in bitcoin and have taxes all paid in bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people's bitcoin wallets. Because then there's no accounting, there's no auditing, there's no bookkeeping, it's all done on the blockchain. It's all honest and it's all straight."" Draper was one of the early advocates of crypto. He realized the significance of bitcoin in 2013 following the notorious collapse of the Mt. Gox crypto exchange, he said in an interview in 2014, in which he noted that he had bought 30,000 bitcoin after the incident. Since then, he’s been a big investor in the cryptocurrency and projects related to it, leading multiple funding rounds for startups in the space. In 2018, Draper first made the bold prediction that bitcoin would hit $250,000 in June 2023 and he stuck with that prognostication even through the recent bear market, up until now.",even though billionaire investor and venture capitalist tim draper be clearly wrong when he predict would reach in june he say he still believe that it will happen eventually maybe in i wasnt really expect for the us bureaucracy to be this aggressive and i think that maybe they would be recognize that they get to compete with the rest of the world draper admit in an interview on bloomberg tv on tuesday he say that the security and exchange commission sec recent enforcement action against company such as coinbase and binance have be drive entrepreneur out of the united state which in turn have hurt the of but that doesnt change how valuable and its underlying technology be accord to draper read more could rise to k by end standard charter its a great system its great its a great way to operate he say i cant wait until i can raise a fund all in invest it all in have my portfolio company all pay their employee and supplier all in and have tax all pay in and have the waterfall all fall into people wallet because then theres no accounting theres no audit theres no bookkeeping its all do on the blockchain its all honest and its all straight draper be one of the early advocate of he realize the significance of in follow the notorious collapse of the mt gox exchange he say in an interview in in which he note that he have buy after the incident since then hes be a big investor in the and project relate to it lead multiple funding round for startup in the space in draper first make the bold prediction that would hit in june and he stick with that prognostication even through the recent bear up until now,4,1,0.5656565656565656,"[('draper', 5), ('great', 3), ('investor', 2), ('june', 2), ('interview', 2), ('exchange', 2), ('recent', 2), ('company', 2)]"
COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/11/the-big-robert-f-kennedy-jr-bitcoin-nothingburger/," Reportedly, presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been caught supposedly in a lie about bitcoin (BTC), apparently. According to a CNBC report, the Kennedy family scion previously stated publicly he “was not an investor” in bitcoin though recently reported he held downwards of $250,000 in the cryptocurrency in a financial disclosure form. RFK has made waves in the crypto community, including a pit stop at the largest annual industry conference Bitcoin Miami where he told the crowd he’d “defend the right of self-custody of bitcoin and other digital assets.” He also said his campaign is accepting BTC donations, though he personally did not own any of the cryptocurrency. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. “I am not here to give investment advice,” he stated, echoing a popular refrain in online investment communities. Apparently, however, the good old boy took some advice himself while in Florida and invested at least $100,001 in crypto between the date of the conference and the end of June, according to a filing CNBC obtained. RFK’s campaign confirmed the purchase. But because this is CRYPTO and because this is POLITICS, of course there is a debate. Virginia Canter, principal counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a Washington D.C.-based ethics organization, said Kennedy’s investment is a potential conflict of interest, a claim Kennedy campaign manager Dennis Kucinich denied. Canter’s claim is that, if a politician endorses an investment he or his family members hold, it shows bias, and can be perceived as untoward. When the report first came out, the Kennedy campaign said the bitcoin belonged to Robert’s wife and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star Cheryl Hines, and later corrected the record. The filing shows the crypto holdings returned less than $201 in income. Versions of this same debate about potential conflicts have long followed crypto, which makes sense given blockchains are semi-anonymous and allow anyone to buy into a network bypassing traditional investment guardrails. In the media, especially, there are concerns that journalists on the crypto beat can hold digital assets without disclosure and potentially influence markets among more subtle concerns about sentiment and. See also: Should Crypto Journalists Own Crypto? | Opinion Thankfully, for bitcoin, at least, we need not be too concerned. Yes, a high-profile presidential challenger could likely tilt the scales if they endorse an asset while campaigning. But so could any number of world events. Bitcoin is almost assuredly a commodity under U.S. law, meaning there can be stakeholders in the asset but no single party would benefit most from its adoption. Just like how there are buyers, miners, builders, architects, sculptors, etc. who use a metal like copper and may be exposed to its long and short term price fluctuations, there is a massive pool of bitcoin users who hold stake. That pool would include sitting elected representatives like Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). Kennedy, who has been accused of spreading anti-vaxxer disinformation, has garnered support among a number of bitcoiners including Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Junior has been outspoken in his support of crypto, including criticizing a proposed 30% tax on crypto mining and calling a recent spate of regulatory action against the industry “an extra-legal war” that has damaged the country's economic prospects. His bitcoin buy is suggestive of a lot: that he puts his money where his mouth is, that he’s easily influenced by gungho conference goers or even that he buys into the “digital gold” narrative. (Being honest, Kennedy strikes me as the type of boomer who would be hawking gold investments on talk radio, if his family wasn’t already political royalty.) No one knows Kennedy’s true state of mind or motivations here, but what should be clear enough is that there is no inconsistency in defending the rights of bitcoiners and holding the asset. Further, .000033 BTC is almost certainly enough to make a rich man rich, but it’s probably enough to hold him to his promises.",reportedly presidential candidate robert f kennedy jr have be catch supposedly in a lie about apparently accord to a cnbc report the kennedy family scion previously state publicly he be not an investor in though recently report he hold downwards of in the in a financial disclosure form rfk have make wave in the community include a pit stop at the large annual industry conference miami where he tell the crowd hed defend the right of selfcustody of and other s he also say his campaign be accept donation though he personally do not own any of the this be an excerpt from the node newsletter a daily roundup of the most pivotal news on and beyond you can subscribe to get the full newsletter here i be not here to give investment advice he state echo a popular refrain in online investment community apparently however the good old boy take some advice himself while in florida and invest at least in between the date of the conference and the end of june accord to a filing cnbc obtain rfks campaign confirm the purchase but because this be and because this be politics of course there be a debate virginia canter principal counsel for citizen for responsibility and ethic in washington a washington dcbased ethic organization say kennedys investment be a potential conflict of interest a claim kennedy campaign manager dennis kucinich deny canter claim be that if a politician endorse an investment he or his family member hold it show bias and can be perceive as untoward when the report first come out the kennedy campaign say the belong to roberts wife and curb your enthusiasm star cheryl hines and later correct the record the filing show the holding return less than in income version of this same debate about potential conflict have long follow which make sense give blockchains be semianonymous and allow anyone to buy into a network bypass traditional investment guardrail in the medium especially there be concern that journalist on the beat can hold s without disclosure and potentially influence s among more subtle concern about sentiment and see also should journalist own | opinion thankfully for at least we need not be too concerned yes a highprofile presidential challenger could likely tilt the scale if they endorse an while campaigning but so could any number of world event be almost assuredly a commodity under us law mean there can be stakeholder in the but no single party would benefit most from its adoption just like how there be buyer miner builder architect sculptor etc who use a metal like copper and may be expose to its long and short term fluctuation there be a massive pool of user who hold stake that pool would include sit elected representative like senator ted cruz rtx and cynthia lummis rwy kennedy who have be accuse of spread antivaxxer disinformation have garner support among a number of er include block ceo jack dorsey junior have be outspoken in his support of include criticize a propose tax on mining and call a recent spate of regulatory action against the industry an extralegal war that have damage the countrys economic prospect his buy be suggestive of a lot that he put his money where his mouth be that he easily influence by gungho conference goer or even that he buy into the gold narrative be honest kennedy strike me as the type of boomer who would be hawk gold investment on talk radio if his family wasnt already political royalty no one know kennedys true state of mind or motivation here but what should be clear enough be that there be no inconsistency in defend the right of er and hold the further be almost certainly enough to make a rich man rich but its probably enough to hold him to his promise,8,0,0.6934673366834171,"[('kennedy', 6), ('hold', 6), ('investment', 6), ('include', 4), ('campaign', 4), ('report', 3), ('family', 3), ('state', 3)]"
COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/11/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-application-takes-surveillance-to-the-next-level/," The moment finance giant BlackRock filed to create a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., market watchers wondered whether the world’s biggest asset manager had a better chance of approval than the many rejected predecessors. They quickly fixated on a mechanism within the application that allows suspicious trades to be flagged to the authorities. BlackRock’s application sparked a flurry of follow-on filings with the now-ubiquitous Surveillance-Sharing Agreement (SSA) added. But what’s more likely to influence the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision is an information-sharing deal that flips the position of power in the arrangement and gives regulators the right to demand extra background. While the SEC’s requirement for surveillance sharing to prevent market manipulation of crypto is not new – it first appeared in the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF application in 2017 – details of a “Coinbase and NASDAQ Information Sharing Term Sheet” shared with CoinDesk point to something more. The nuance here can be characterized as the difference between push and pull. The SSA concerns data surveillance carried out by the spot exchange, Coinbase (COIN) in this case, which can be pushed to regulators, ETF providers and listing exchanges if deemed suspicious. Information-sharing agreements, in contrast, allow regulators and ETF providers to pull data from the exchange. The information in question could be about specific trades or traders, and the agreement also compels a crypto exchange to share data up to and including personally identifiable information (PII), such as the customer’s name and address. Information-sharing agreements do not appear in any of the spot bitcoin ETF filings, but the structure is found in other markets. An important caveat is that an information-sharing request has to be very specific, not dissimilar to a subpoena, according to a person familiar with the matter. “It can’t just be a fishing expedition, where it’s all of the information attached to any trade that was made between two given points in time,” said the person, who asked to remain unidentified. “The obvious concern is that crypto traders, almost by definition, don’t like having information shared about them. It’s sort of anathema to the ethos of crypto in general. But for the ETF to be successful, [firms] have to do it.” Nasdaq and Coinbase declined to comment. BlackRock did not respond to requests for comment. Going back to 2017, the SEC has highlighted the need for bitcoin ETF applications to have a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size, but firms have lacked clarity and an objective standard when it comes to interpreting this. The inclusion of an information-sharing agreement, as opposed to simply surveillance sharing, makes sense, because it means an ETF is not reliant on an unregulated market, said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. Bitwise has applied for an ETF numerous times. “If there’s an ability to pull, then that’s coming from the regulated market; an ability to push is coming from the unregulated market,” Hougan said in an interview. “So, the SEC will want the ability for the regulated market to oversee this surveillance, and in terms of identifying the people at the bottom of these trades, I think that’s just going to be part and parcel of these agreements.” The combination of surveillance sharing and information sharing is a structure known to brokers and exchanges in equities markets, where the regulator has the authority to request more information about the end client’s trading history. Whenever a broker has a client that sends an order to Nasdaq, for example, and that order is flagged as suspicious by the exchange’s SMARTS surveillance system, then the broker and the exchange are required to file a suspicious activity report (SAR). Regulators investigating a SAR can go on to this “second step,” said Dave Weisberger, CEO of crypto trading platform CoinRoutes, which is requesting PII to identify whether the same beneficial owners are behind a given set of trades, creating a consolidated audit trail. “Coinbase, Nasdaq and BlackRock are likely saying that if there is suspicious activity – and they are surveilling for it – then the regulator can request who’s doing it, but they’re not just going to give out PII willy-nilly. There is going to have to be suspicious activity. That is the equivalency here,” Weisberger said in an interview, adding: “If that is true, I believe the SEC will not only approve this ETF, but will approve it and take a victory lap. And considering how unpopular this SEC is, I suspect they need to do that now.”",the moment finance giant blackrock file to create a spot etf in the us watcher wonder whether the world big manager have a good chance of approval than the many reject predecessor they quickly fixate on a mechanism within the application that allow suspicious trade to be flag to the authority blackrocks application spark a flurry of followon filing with the nowubiquitous surveillancesharing agreement ssa add but whats more likely to influence the us security and exchange commission sec decision be an informationsharing deal that flip the position of power in the arrangement and give regulator the right to demand extra background while the secs requirement for surveillance sharing to prevent manipulation of be not new it first appear in the winklevoss etf application in detail of a coinbase and nasdaq information share term sheet share with point to something more the nuance here can be characterize as the difference between push and pull the ssa concern data surveillance carry out by the spot exchange coinbase coin in this case which can be push to regulator etf provider and listing exchange if deem suspicious informationsharing agreement in contrast allow regulator and etf provider to pull data from the exchange the information in question could be about specific trade or trader and the agreement also compel a exchange to share data up to and include personally identifiable information pii such as the customer name and address informationsharing agreement do not appear in any of the spot etf filing but the structure be find in other s an important caveat be that an informationsharing request have to be very specific not dissimilar to a subpoena accord to a person familiar with the matter it cant just be a fishing expedition where its all of the information attach to any trade that be make between two give point in time say the person who ask to remain unidentified the obvious concern be that trader almost by definition dont like have information share about them its sort of anathema to the ethos of in general but for the etf to be successful [ firm ] have to do it nasdaq and coinbase decline to comment blackrock do not respond to request for comment go back to the sec have highlight the need for etf application to have a surveillancesharing agreement with a regulate of significant size but firm have lack clarity and an objective standard when it come to interpret this the inclusion of an informationsharing agreement as oppose to simply surveillance share make sense because it mean an etf be not reliant on an unregulated say matt hougan chief investment officer at bitwise management bitwise have apply for an etf numerous time if there an ability to pull then thats come from the regulate an ability to push be come from the unregulated hougan say in an interview so the sec will want the ability for the regulate to oversee this surveillance and in term of identify the people at the bottom of these trade i think thats just go to be part and parcel of these agreement the combination of surveillance sharing and information sharing be a structure know to broker and exchange in equity s where the regulator have the authority to request more information about the end client trade history whenever a broker have a client that send an order to nasdaq for example and that order be flag as suspicious by the exchange smart surveillance system then the broker and the exchange be require to file a suspicious activity report sar regulator investigate a sar can go on to this second step say dave weisberger ceo of trading platform coinroutes which be request pii to identify whether the same beneficial owner be behind a give set of trade create a consolidated audit trail coinbase nasdaq and blackrock be likely say that if there be suspicious activity and they be surveilling for it then the regulator can request whos do it but theyre not just go to give out pii willynilly there be go to have to be suspicious activity that be the equivalency here weisberger say in an interview add if that be true i believe the sec will not only approve this etf but will approve it and take a victory lap and consider how unpopular this sec be i suspect they need to do that now,3,1,0.7675675675675675,"[('etf', 10), ('exchange', 8), ('agreement', 7), ('information', 7), ('suspicious', 6), ('trade', 6), ('regulator', 6), ('surveillance', 6)]"

It turns out Arkham has already been leaking its own customers’ private information, a revelation that also seems to have emerged Monday, putting a spotlight on the companys own approach to user privacy just as it was rolling out a service meant to unmask crypto wallet owners on a massive scale. The issue stems from the way Arkham set up its weblink referral program. Users of Arkham’s wallet tracking dashboard can invite others onto the platform by sharing their unique referral URL. Those URLs appear to end with a meaningless jumble of characters. In reality, they’re an easy-to-decipher version of the user’s email address written in Base64, which is trivial to decode.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/marex-unveils-bitcoin-ether-linked-long-strategy-with-dollar-index-as-hedge/," London-based financial services platform Marex has launched a volatility-adjusted strategy tied to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and the dollar index (DXY) futures to cater to investors wary of the relatively high price turbulence in the crypto market. Marex said the strategy is already being marketed to clients. Bitcoin and ether have equal weight in the strategy, with the DXY futures acting as a hedge. The basket is consistently rebalanced between BTC, ETH, and DXY futures to target annualized volatility of 8%. When volatility rises, the strategy cuts exposure to risk assets – BTC, ETH – and increases exposure to DXY. When volatility falls, the basket rebalances toward BTC and ETH. The strategy takes advantage of the DXY's safe-haven appeal and bitcoin and ether's tendency to behave like risk assets to keep the net volatility exposure of the portfolio as close to the target value as possible in all market environments. ""This is the first institutional grade FX and crypto vol targeted strategy,"" Mark Arasaratnam, co-head of Digital Assets at Marex, said in an email. ""It's targeted to investors wanting to gain some exposure to crypto but are concerned about its volatility."" Arasaratnam added that the DXY acts as a robust complement to the long-only portfolio from both a thematic and empirical perspective. Per Marex's pitch deck, at the current level of volatility, the strategy would provide a 12% exposure to digital assets and the rest to the DXY futures. While crypto propounders hail bitcoin as a safe haven asset, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise, with the top cryptocurrency chalking out major rallies during sustained weakness in the U.S. dollar. The dollar, meanwhile, remains a hedge against systematic uncertainty, acting as a haven during times of stress in both crypto and wider markets. The two have had a persistent negative correlation over the past three years. Thus, the DXY component of the strategy ensures less volatility and lower drawdowns. Research by Marex suggests the basket involving DXY as the hedge asset would have generated a return of 29% between Jan. 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023 (a period consisting of both bullish and bearish trends). That's significantly higher than the return from the classic buy-and-hold strategies.",londonbased financial service platform marex have launch a volatilityadjusted strategy tie to ether eth and the dollar index dxy future to cater to investor wary of the relatively high turbulence in the marex say the strategy be already be ed to client and ether have equal weight in the strategy with the dxy future act as a hedge the basket be consistently rebalanced between eth and dxy future to target annualized volatility of when volatility rise the strategy cut exposure to risk s eth and increase exposure to dxy when volatility fall the basket rebalances toward and eth the strategy take advantage of the dxys safehaven appeal and and ether tendency to behave like risk s to keep the net volatility exposure of the portfolio as close to the target value as possible in all environment this be the first institutional grade fx and vol target strategy mark arasaratnam cohead of s at marex say in an email its target to investor want to gain some exposure to but be concern about its volatility arasaratnam add that the dxy act as a robust complement to the longonly portfolio from both a thematic and empirical perspective per marexs pitch deck at the current level of volatility the strategy would provide a exposure to s and the rest to the dxy future while propounders hail as a safe haven the empirical evidence suggest otherwise with the top chalking out major rally during sustained weakness in the us dollar the dollar meanwhile remain a hedge against systematic uncertainty act as a haven during time of stress in both and wide s the two have have a persistent negative correlation over the past three year thus the dxy component of the strategy ensure less volatility and low drawdowns research by marex suggest the basket involve dxy as the hedge would have generate a return of between jan to june a period consisting of both bullish and bearish trend thats significantly high than the return from the classic buyandhold strategy,3,1,0.5149253731343284,"[('strategy', 9), ('dxy', 8), ('volatility', 7), ('exposure', 5), ('marex', 4), ('eth', 4), ('future', 4), ('target', 4)]"

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/bitcoin-ordinals-back-in-spotlight-with-over-35m-inscriptions/," Activity in Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs, a method of generating Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing, has picked up in the wake of the BRC-69 token standard launch. The number of new inscriptions rose to over 350,000 on Monday, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The daily tally has surged by over 250% since Ordinals launchpad Luminex unveiled the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC)-69 token standard on July 3. The modified version of the BRC-20 standard was launched to reduce the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%. ""With BRC69, we can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90%. This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets,"" Luminex said in a Tweet thread. ""The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity. Minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions,"" Luminex added. So far, BTC-69 seems to have delivered on its promise. While the number of new inscriptions has surged, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics. Ordinals went live in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network. Per Glassnode, the Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, with the first representing activity between early February and late April.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/crypto-catalyst-watch-june-cpi-ppi-readings-hold-the-spotlight/," After a week of key jobs reports, inflation data is returning  to the spotlight this week with Wednesday’s release of the U.S. June Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index the following day. Investors will be looking for declines that could justify the U.S. central bank reversing course on its intent to raise interest rates 25 basis points (bps). A return to monetary hawkishness would follow the Federal Reserve pausing rate hikes last month for the first time in more than a year. The Fed’s prescription has helped cut the CPI from 9% in August 2022 to May’s 4% reading, although it has more recently also raised concerns about an overstep that could cast the economy into a steep recession. On Wednesday, observers of U.S. monetary policy will eye the Labor Department’s release of the June CPI. The CPI has edged steadily downward since last year’s high. Economists’ consensus see June’s index dipping in the mid 3% range, although Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Monday note that it could tumble to 2.8%. Yet Moya also noted that core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, could remain hot, a result of an expensive housing market. “Pricing pressures might remain throughout the summer,” Moya wrote. The PPI, which measures price changes at the wholesale level, often foreshadows changes that consumers face in the future. The May PPI sank to 1.1% annually, beating expectations for a 1.5% decline and down sharply from the previous month’s 2.3% reading. The consensus is for a 0.4% reading in June. Also on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department announces jobless claims for the week ending July 8. Recent jobs data has offered slightly different perspectives on the state of the state of the jobs market. Last week’s ADP report showed businesses adding almost a half-million private sector jobs, more than double economists’ expectations. The unexpectedly strong results offered support for the Fed to reapply its aggressive inflation treatments. A strong employment market suggests that the economy is expanding, which often precedes higher prices. But an unexpected – albeit slight – increase in jobless claims the same day and mild nonfarm jobs report later in the week added nuance to the overall picture.",after a of key job report inflation data be return to the spotlight this with wednesdays release of the us june consumer index cpi and the producer index the following day investor will be look for decline that could justify the us central bank reverse course on its intent to raise interest rate basis point bps a return to monetary hawkishness would follow the federal reserve pause rate hike last month for the first time in more than a year the fed prescription have help cut the cpi from in august to mays read although it have more recently also raise concern about an overstep that could cast the economy into a steep recession on wednesday observer of us monetary policy will eye the labor department release of the june cpi the cpi have edge steadily downward since last year high economist consensus see june index dip in the mid range although edward moya senior analyst at foreign exchange maker oanda write in a monday note that it could tumble to yet moya also note that core inflation which exclude more volatile food and energy cost could remain hot a result of an expensive housing pricing pressure might remain throughout the summer moya write the ppi which measure change at the wholesale level often foreshadow change that consumer face in the future the may ppi sank to annually beat expectation for a decline and down sharply from the previous month read the consensus be for a reading in june also on thursday the us labor department announce jobless claim for the end july recent job data have offer slightly different perspective on the state of the state of the job last s adp report show business add almost a halfmillion private sector job more than double economist expectation the unexpectedly strong result offer support for the fed to reapply its aggressive inflation treatment a strong employment suggest that the economy be expand which often precede high s but an unexpected albeit slight increase in jobless claim the same day and mild nonfarm job report later in the added nuance to the overall picture,1,3,0.676470588235294,"[('job', 5), ('june', 4), ('cpi', 4), ('report', 3), ('inflation', 3), ('index', 3), ('moya', 3), ('data', 2)]"
COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/11/first-mover-asia-individual-wallets-holding-1-bitcoin-hit-all-time-high-as-btc-maintains-30k/," Good morning. Here’s what’s happening: Prices: Bitcoin continues to show healthy signs of decentralization, even as it has liquidity issues. Insights: A lack of dollar liquidity means some weird things are happening on Binance.US. Bitcoin's Decentralization is Alive and Well as it Maintains $30K Mark Bitcoin is opening the Tuesday trading day in Asia at $30,366, maintaining a strong presence above $30K. While the trading volume and market movements have been fairly flat over the last few days, as the market continues its struggle with liquidity, bitcoin has recently passed a symbolic milestone. The number of wallets holding at least one bitcoin has reached an all-time high of 1,008,737 million, according to data from Glassnode. This increased distribution of wallets with at least one bitcoin suggests increased decentralization of the network. Meanwhile, Glassnode’s data shows that the number of whales is also decreasing. The number of wallets holding at least one bitcoin first crossed the million mark in May and has been rising since. All this comes as the popularity of ordinals increases the load on the Bitcoin network. A number of metrics are showing increased activity, from an uptick in miners transferring coins to exchanges to the number of addresses with a balance greater than 0.1. Bitcoin’s next big moves will likely come later this week as jobless claims and CPI data are released, both of which will indicate how successful the Fed’s moves at taming inflation are – data that traders zoom in on when making their next moves. Binance.US Has a Free Money Problem Binance.US was always meant to be the fiat pipeline for U.S. nationals wanting to use Binance. But as of last month, it’s having trouble fulfilling that role as its fiat pipelines are suspended. With no fiat liquidity, this has put the exchange in a weird place. Bitcoin is trading at a discount of 9%, as is Tether (USDT); the world’s biggest dollar-pegged stablecoin is trading at a nearly 9-cent discount from other exchanges. The exchange’s market depth or traders’ ability to execute large orders at stable prices has also deteriorated significantly in recent months, aiding wild price action. Data from research group Kaiko shows that market depth has collapsed on Binance.US, with an over 60% drop in liquidity available on the platform in June. Adrian Wang, founder, and CEO at digital assets wealth management firm Metalpha, points to the looming withdrawal deadline of July 20 as a reason for the depegging. “As the days approach this deadline, lesser liquidity and lesser banks to exchange fiat means that we may see this de-peg continue,” he told CoinDesk. An easy trade right now is to buy USDT at a discount on Binance.US and move it elsewhere to trade with. But it just can’t involve fiat ramps – the bread and butter of most of Binance.US’ users. “I think there might be some arbitrage opportunities for institutions or market makers, but retail traders wouldn’t likely have the risk tolerance or understanding,” Nick Ruck, COO of DeFi protocol ContentFi Labs said to CoinDesk in a note. Certainly, many have been doing this to enjoy free money; in the last week the exchange has had a netflow of negative $16.2 million, according to Nansen.ai data. Although some have said such a trade is not worth the risk. But the question is, why hasn’t this resolved itself? Why hasn’t it either brought down Tether’s overall value, or pushed back up the value of USDT on Binance.US? “Compared with the total circulation of USDT, the selling volume is not enough to affect the overall market price in the end,” Tony Ling, co-founder of data portal NFTGo, and a partner at Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk. “There have been more serious price deviations before, and nothing happened in the end.” For now, enjoy the free money.

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/10/bitcoin-falls-below-31k-after-late-monday-surge/," Bitcoin returned briefly on Monday to its recent, loftier heights above $31,000 before dipping slightly below the threshold. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,690, up almost 2% over the past 24 hours as investors seemed to regain the enthusiasm they held following spot bitcoin ETF filings by BlackRock and other financial services giants in mid June and other mildly crypto-friendly events during the month. BTC last traded above $31,000 on Thursday. It sank along with other assets amid renewed inflationary worries raised primarily by an unexpectedly robust ADP private sector jobs report, even sinking below its most recent support of $30,000. But those concerns seemed to vanish, and after lingering just above this level, bitcoin jumped more than 2% over a roughly 90-minute period during the afternoon before retreating. Bitcoin has risen 20% over the past month, much of the gains coming after the spot BTC filings. A report by British multinational bank, Standard Chartered Bank, early Wednesday (ET) said that bitcoin could hit $50,000 by year's end and over $120,000 by the close of 2024. Read More: Bitcoin Could Rise to $120K by End-2024: Standard Chartered ""Today’s lift in digital assets comes from several June tailwinds that are only now being digested,"" Mark Connors, head of research for digital asset management firm 3iQ, wrote to CoinDesk. ""June price action was BTC dominant due to the slew of spot BTC ETF filings,"" he wrote, also noting favorable comments about the application by former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton. In a CNBC appearance Monday, Clayton said that if the filings addressed certain protections that bitcoin futures ETFs include, that it would be difficult to ""resist approving a (spot) bitcoin ETF."" Connors wrote that investors may also be slowly warming to the possible approval of the Congressional Digital Assets Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, which would establish whether a digital asset is decentralized. ""If passed into law, such a determination can be meaningful as most developers do not want to join a centralized entity bound by securities laws,"" he wrote. Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,890, up 1.8% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos turned from red to increase or jumped more squarely into positive territory with MATIC and ADA, the tokens of the smart contracts platforms Polygon and Cardano, rising more than 6% and 2%, respectively. BNB, the native crypto of the Binance exchange recently rose over 4%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up 1.9%. Equity indexes rebounded from a rare 2023 off week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ticking up as investors looked hopefully toward Wednesday's June U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI sank to 4% in May, down from the 9% reading of almost a year ago. Consensus estimates call for the index to fall below 4%, although Edward Moya, senior analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a note Monday that CPI could tumble to 2.8% even as housing prices remain inflated. The potentially contradictory data and last week's confounding jobs data (nonfarm payrolls sank slightly) could complicate the U.S. central bank's much anticipated decision to raise the interest rate later this month. The Federal Reserve probability tracker is currently forecasting a more than 90% likelihood of a 25 basis point rate hike (bps), but critics of the Fed's more than year-long monetary hawkishness believe bankers are overstepping and risk casting the economy into a recession. ""Even if we get a hot report, the Fed is locked into delivering a quarter-point rate rise,"" Moya wrote. ""Following last month’s pause, the Fed seems positioned to remain aggressive with signaling tightening until we see a much more meaningful slowdown."" Aggressive rate increases have weighed heavily on crypto markets. Moya expects bitcoin to remain at about $30,000 ""as Wall Street awaits any US Bitcoin ETF update, and as market expectations for a 25 basis point hike at the next Fed meeting seems very likely.""

COINDESK,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/10/apple-may-not-like-it-but-zapple-pay-finds-workaround-for-bitcoin-tipping-on-damus/," Last month, Apple (AAPL) threatened to remove the Bitcoin-friendly social media app Damus from its App Store for allowing users to tip or “zap” each other with bitcoin (BTC) on content posted in the app – a prohibited practice the tech giant reportedly considers equivalent to selling digital media. Damus creator William Casarin eventually conceded, resolving the standoff by removing the app’s ability to send zaps on posts or notes; users were still able to tip each other at the profile level. Read more: Bitcoin-Friendly App Damus Avoids Apple Deplatforming After 2-Week Battle Over 'Zaps' Tipping But now, a pair of independent developers have come up with what appears to be a workaround – and they believe that this time, Apple may be all but powerless to stop them. On July 6, barely two weeks after Casarin’s concession, the new Zapple Pay service went live – the brainchild of two Bitcoin developers who say they have no affiliation to Casarin or Damus. They say they discovered a way to enable zaps via emojis. Since emojis are allowed on posts, the app’s users can once again send zaps on posts, despite Apple’s restrictions. The two Bitcoin developers behind Zapple Pay are Ben Carman and Paul Miller. The pair are also co-founders of Mutiny wallet, a browser-based, Lightning-enabled and self-custodial bitcoin wallet. Users who want to try the new service simply provide their Nostr public key (npub), an emoji, and a link to a wallet. Nostr is an acronym for “notes and other stuff transmitted by relays.” “When they react to a post with that emoji, we initiate a zap to that post,” Carman told CoinDesk. Since Zapple Pay is a third-party service, it’s not clear if Apple can or will take any action against Damus and engage in a game of Whac-A-Mole with Carman and Miller. “If Apple is that petty, then there's no real appeasing them in the long term,” Miller said. “We could build the exact same functionality on top of any social network.” Casarin, the Damus creator, insists that he had no role in the development of Zapple Pay, nor any affiliation with the developers. Damus is popular with bitcoiners, partly because of the tipping feature, and advocates for the cryptocurrency had chimed in on its behalf, after Apple’s crackdown. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whose current company Block (SQ) is largely Bitcoin-focused, went as far as calling out Apple CEO Tim Cook on the matter. On July 8, Dorsey appeared to acknowledge the efforts of the Zapple Pay developers, posting on the Damus app, ""Zaps always find a way,"" with a link to the team's website. Prior to forcing Casarin to remove zaps on posts from Damus, Apple recommended he enable zaps that use its mobile payment service Apple Pay instead. “Apple banning note zaps is like trying to ban hyperlinks in browsers,” Casarin told CoinDesk. “It's just a piece of technology and they have zero power to stop it.” CoinDesk reached out to Apple for comment and its spokesperson had not responded at the time of publication. “We could build the same thing for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,” Carman said. “So if they go after Damus, then we'll replicate it for Twitter and try to force their hand.”",last month apple aapl threaten to remove the friendly social medium app damus from its app store for allow user to tip or zap each other with on content post in the app a prohibited practice the tech giant reportedly considers equivalent to sell medium damus creator william casarin eventually concede resolve the standoff by remove the apps ability to send zap on post or note user be still able to tip each other at the profile level read more friendly app damus avoids apple deplatforming after battle over zap tip but now a pair of independent developer have come up with what appear to be a workaround and they believe that this time apple may be all but powerless to stop them on july barely two s after casarins concession the new zapple pay service go live the brainchild of two developer who say they have no affiliation to casarin or damus they say they discover a way to enable zap via emojis since emojis be allow on post the apps user can once again send zap on post despite apple restriction the two developer behind zapple pay be ben carman and paul miller the pair be also cofounder of mutiny wallet a browserbased lightningenabled and selfcustodial wallet user who want to try the new service simply provide their nostr public key npub an emoji and a link to a wallet nostr be an acronym for note and other stuff transmit by relay when they react to a post with that emoji we initiate a zap to that post carman tell since zapple pay be a thirdparty service its not clear if apple can or will take any action against damus and engage in a game of whacamole with carman and miller if apple be that petty then theres no real appease them in the long term miller say we could build the exact same functionality on top of any social network casarin the damus creator insist that he have no role in the development of zapple pay nor any affiliation with the developer damus be popular with er partly because of the tipping feature and advocate for the had chime in on its behalf after apple crackdown former twitter ceo jack dorsey whose current company block sq be largely focused go as far as call out apple ceo tim cook on the matter on july dorsey appear to acknowledge the effort of the zapple pay developer post on the damus app zap always find a way with a link to the team website prior to force casarin to remove zap on post from damus apple recommend he enable zap that use its mobile payment service apple pay instead apple ban note zap be like try to ban hyperlink in browser casarin tell its just a piece of technology and they have zero power to stop it reach out to apple for comment and its spokesperson have not respond at the time of publication we could build the same thing for twitter facebook instagram carman say so if they go after damus then well replicate it for twitter and try to force their hand,1,0,0.4709302325581396,"[('apple', 12), ('damus', 10), ('zap', 10), ('post', 8), ('pay', 6), ('app', 5), ('casarin', 5), ('developer', 5)]"
