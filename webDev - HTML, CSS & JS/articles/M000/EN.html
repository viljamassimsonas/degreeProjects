<p>An ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls increased by 132,000 jobs in August, falling
    short of economists' forecast of job growth of 288,000, according to a Reuters poll. </p>
<p>The more comprehensive and closely watched jobs data on Friday is expcted to show nonfarm payrolls rose
    by 300,000 last month after recording a 528,000 increase in July.</p>
<p>Any signs of a cooling job market would be welcomed by investors as it could ease the pressure on the
    Federal Reserve to stick to outsized rate hikes.</p>
<p>"We continue to believe that the U.S. economy is relatively strong compared to Europe but the Fed will
    not believe that inflation is coming down until we see a couple of months of drop in prices," said Jay Hatfield,
    chief executive officer at Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.</p>
<p>The three main indexes are set for sharp monthly declines, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 4%
    after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's blunt and
    hawkish remarks on Friday about keeping monetary policy tight "for some time" quashed hopes of more modest rate
    hikes. </p>

    weighed on investors' minds heading into September, which is typically a weak month for stock market returns.</p>

    beating in last few days due to a surge

<p>Marathon Oil slipped 3.2% to lead declines among oil stocks as U.S. crude prices
    slid about 3% to $89 a barrel on recession fears. </p>
<p>"Oil is down and that's usually good for tech stocks. If oil is down that means inflation is coming
    down. There is a 5% bleed through from oil prices to core CPI," Hatfield said.</p>
